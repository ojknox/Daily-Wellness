# Daily wellness page

This is a project I created so users can have some pieces of wellness to start their day. The website accesses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), an [inspirational quote API](https://api.goprogram.ai/inspiration/docs/), a [horoscope API](https://aztro.sameerkumar.website/) and the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/).
